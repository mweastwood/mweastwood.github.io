## The Owens Valley Long Wavelength Array

[The Owens Valley Long Wavelength Array (OVRO-LWA)](http://www.tauceti.caltech.edu/LWA/) is a
low-frequency (roughly 30 to 85 MHz) radio telescope located at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory
(OVRO) near Big Pine, California.  Instead of a large mirror, the OVRO-LWA is composed of 288
antennas that work together to detect radio waves arriving at Earth from the far reaches of the
cosmos.

If you look up at the night sky with your own eyes, you can see stars, the moon, and other planets
(like Mars and Jupiter). On a dark night you can see the Milky Way, and with the help of a small
telescope or binoculars you can see star clusters, nebulae, and other galaxies.

The radio sky as seen by the OVRO-LWA is very different. The plane of the Milky Way, our own galaxy,
glows intensely bright from the synchrotron radiation of electrons trapped in the plane of the
galaxy, but moving at speeds near the speed of light. The cooling remnants of stars that died
thousands of years ago in spectacular supernova explosions are plainly visible, and distant galaxies
fill the sky like stars due to their supermassive-black-hole-powered radio emission.
