The term "cosmic dawn" refers to the epoch of early star formation that signals the
end of the dark ages. If you put the history of the universe on a calendar where
January 1 corresponds to the big bang, and December 31 corresponds to the present day,
then January 5 is the cosmic dawn.
During this period the very first stars light up and the very first galaxies form.

These stars and galaxies are firmly beyond the reach of the current generation of
optical and infrared telescopes
(for example, [the Hubble Space Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope)).
However it might be possible to detect the diffuse hydrogen gas from this era with
a low frequency (long wavelength) radio telescope.
Neutral hydrogen absorbs light at a
characteristic wavelength of 21 centimeters. Because the universe is expanding,
21 centimeter photons emitted from distant clouds of hydrogen gas have been stretched by
the time they reach earth. The amount by which the 21 centimeter photon has been stretched
is a measure of how long the photon has been traveling and therefore how far away the
corresponding hydrogen is. This technique can be used to map the three-dimensional
distribution of hydrogen gas during the cosmic dawn.

Unfortunately the cosmological signature of distant hydrogen gas is very faint, and
it will be very difficult to separate this signal from the blinding light of our
own Milky Way galaxy and other sources of radio emission. Larger telescopes and
sophisticated electronics can make this easier, but a topographical map of hydrogen
is beyond the capabilities of any existing instrument.

I am using the Owens Valley Long Wavelength Array to measure the power spectrum
of 21 centimeter brightness fluctuations during the cosmic dawn. The power spectrum
is a statistical tool that is in many ways similar to shaking a box to guess the
contents of a package without opening it. These measurements (the first of their
kind at redshifts > 20) will provide insight into the early thermal history of the
intergalactic medium, galaxy formation, and star formation.
