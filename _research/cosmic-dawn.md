The term "cosmic dawn" refers to the epoch of early star formation prior to the epoch of reionization. This roughly corresponds to a redshift range of 10 through 30. The 21 cm transition of neutral hydrogen promises to be a powerful tool for probing the state of the intergalactic medium at these redshifts.







Figure 1. This is a cartoon of the theoretically expected direction-averaged spectrum of the cosmic dawn (Kaurov & Gnedin 2015). The x-axis is redshift (which is directly related to frequency). The y-axis is the brightness temperature of the 21 cm transition. The most prominent feature is an absorption trough. This trough is created first by Lyman alpha photons that couple the excitation temperature of the 21 cm transition to the adiabatically cooling gas temperature (through the Wouthuysen-Field effect). Later X-ray heating of the IGM takes over and sends the signal into emission.













Figure 2. Instead of averaging over direction, we can instead attempt to measure the magnitude of the fluctuations in the 21 cm brightness temperature on some comoving length scale. This quantity is called the spatial power spectrum. At the most basic level, the amplitude of the cosmic dawn power spectrum peaks at two redshifts: when inhomogeneous star formation creates an inhomogeneous bath of Lyman alpha photons, and when X-ray sources begin to heat up the universe starting with the area around themselves (Pritchard & Furlanetto 2007).

If the X-ray sources have a particularly hard spectrum (for example, if the heating is dominated by high-mass X-ray binaries) then the latter peak may be washed out (Fialkov & Barkana 2014). The supersonic motion of baryons relative to the dark matter following recombination suppresses star formation in low mass halos, enhancing the amplitude of the fluctuations and imprinting the signature of BAO onto the power spectrum (Tseliakhovich & Hirata 2010). However strong Lyman-Werner feedback may temper the effects of baryon streaming on the power spectrum (Fialkov et al. 2013).
