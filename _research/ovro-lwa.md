The Owens Valley Long Wavelength Array (LWA) is a 288-antenna interferometer located
at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO) near Big Pine, California. The LWA detects
radio waves with wavelengths between 3.5 meters and 10 meters. Longer wavelengths
actually reflect off the Earth's ionosphere so the radio waves detect by the LWA have
the longest wavelength that is possible to observe without putting antennas in space.

251 of the 288 antennas are arranged within a 200 meter diameter core that provides
excellent thermal sensitivity. 5 antennas are equipped with noise-switched receivers
that allow for calibrated measurements of the total power detected by each of these
antennas. The remaining 32 antennas are placed up to 2 kilometers away from the central
core of the interferometer. These antennas are used to image the entire sky with 10 arcminute
resolution.

We are used to seeing the plane of our galaxy, the Milky Way, as a faint strip of stars
that is visible during a moonless night. In long wavelength radio waves the Milky Way
is blindingly bright, and outshines even the sun (unless the sun is flaring).
Supernova remnants ([Cassiopeia A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassiopeia_A))
and distant galaxies ([Cygnus A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_A))
can also be brighter than the sun.
At Caltech we are using the LWA to study the infant universe, detect stellar flares,
find extra-solar planets, and characterize the Earth's ionosphere.
