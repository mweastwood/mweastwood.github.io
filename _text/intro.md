## About me

I am an astrophysics PhD student at Caltech and alumnus of Rice University. I helped build a new
low-frequency radio telescope at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory â€” [the Owens Valley Long
Wavelength Array](http://www.tauceti.caltech.edu/LWA/).  Sometimes it even works! I am a member of
the Los Angeles Arboretum and I have fun playing soccer somewhat poorly. I wrote and maintain a
couple [officially registered packages for the Julia programming language]({{ '/software' | prepend:
site.baseurl }}).
