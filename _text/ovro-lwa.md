## The Owens Valley Long Wavelength Array

[The Owens Valley Long Wavelength Array (OVRO-LWA)](http://www.tauceti.caltech.edu/LWA/) is a
low-frequency (roughly 30 to 85 MHz) radio telescope located at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory
(OVRO) near Big Pine, California.  Instead of a large mirror, the OVRO-LWA is composed of 288
antennas that work together coherently to detect radio waves arriving at Earth from the far reaches
of the cosmos.

I helped build the OVRO-LWA as part of a team of scientists and engineers from Caltech, OVRO, JPL,
and Harvard-Smithsonian. At times this involved assembling antennas, untangling (literally) miles of
fiber optic cables in the desert, or even pulling fiber optic cables through conduit like an ox.
However I also wrote a lot of [software]({{ '/software' | prepend: site.baseurl }}) that helped make
the instrument as successful as it is today.

I use the OVRO-LWA to study the distant universe, but it will also search for exoplanets, stellar
flares, solar flares, and other exotic transients using its ability to capture snapshot images of
the entire visible hemisphere.
