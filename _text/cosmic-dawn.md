## The Cosmic Dawn

Imagine putting the history of the universe on a calendar where January 1 corresponds to the big
bang, and December 31 corresponds to the present day. The very first stars are thought to have begun
emitting light around January 5. This period of time -- known as the "cosmic dawn" -- corresponds to
when the universe was merely 5% of its current size.

Due to the finite speed of light, the light emitted from a star ten light-years away takes ten years
to reach the Earth. Consequently we see this star today as it was ten years in the past. By
searching for extremely stars and galaxies, astronomers can observe the universe as it was billions
of years ago, and potentially allowing astronomers to directly study the cosmic dawn.

These stars and galaxies are firmly beyond the reach of the current generation of optical and
infrared telescopes (for example, [the Hubble Space
Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope)).  However a new suite of
low-frequency radio telescopes are attempting to detect the diffuse hydrogen gas from this era using
its characteristic 21 centimeter transition.

Unfortunately the cosmological signature of distant hydrogen gas is very faint, and it will be very
difficult to separate this signal from the blinding light of our own Milky Way galaxy and other
sources of radio emission. I used the [Owens Valley Long Wavelength
Array](http://www.tauceti.caltech.edu/LWA/) to construct a [new map of the sky]({{ '/sky-maps' |
