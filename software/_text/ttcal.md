TTCal is a complex gain calibration routine developed for the OVRO-LWA.

TTCal is designed from the ground up to be well-tested, simple, and easy to modify. It started as an
exercise in learning how calibration works in radio astronomy, but it is now the primary routine by
which sources are peeled from OVRO-LWA datasets.
